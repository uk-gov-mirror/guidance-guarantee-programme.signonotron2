Your Pension Wise Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @user.email %>, has now been suspended and you won't be able to access any Pension Wise <%= account_name %> applications, eg Whitehall Publisher or Licensing.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<%= account_name.humanize %> suspensions do not suspend production accounts or remove access to Pension Wise production applications.

All the best,

The Pension Wise team
