Hello <%= @resource.name %>,

Your Pension Wise Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @resource.email %>, was locked at <%= locked_time %> because the wrong sign on details were entered too many times.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
  <%= account_name.humanize %> locks do not lock production accounts.
<% end %>

Your account will be unlocked at <%= unlock_time %>. If you need your line manager.

All the best,

The Pension Wise team
